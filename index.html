		     After five years of operation, the FutureGrid project has come to an end on September 30, 2014. 
</div><div class="p">
Funded by the NSF, FutureGrid operated a geographically distributed set of heterogeneous computing systems, and enabled research 
and education projects in a variety of topics in computer science and across various application domains. 
Throughout its funded period, FutureGrid hosted XXX projects and YYY users, and the project enabled research leading to 
ZZZ publications and WWW presentations. This static page replaces the FutureGrid portal, summarizes our accomplishments and
 provides information to users of FutureGrid and those interested in using similar infrastructures. 

</div>
<div class="p">We would like to thank users for their input and insights and for making FutureGrid a very successful project.

FutureGrid users can continue their work using FutureSystems or Chameleon. FutureSystems.org will continue to run FutureGrid systems including (india, â€¦?) and will be accessible to (...?). FutureGrid partners, University of Chicago and TACC, have received an NSFCloud award to build an experimental testbed called Chameleon. The FutureGrid resources at University of Chicago and TACC, Hotel and Alamo, will continue to be operated during the first year of the Chameleon project. We will provide documentation and tools as necessary to streamline user transition from FutureGrid to Chameleon so that FutureGrid users can keep their data and access these resources easily.
